          The number of mobile devices is significantly increasing. The
          statistics report published by Federica Laricchia in Mar, 2023 says it
          could be up to 18.22 billion by 2025 from 2020 for 4.2 billion [1].
          The variety of usage has been widespread, especially in AI
          development. Not only AI, Augmented Reality (AR) has come into place.
          It uses mobile hardware to generate and process images. An example of
          using AR technology on mobile devices could be PokemonGo [2], which
          uses the camera and the mobile processors' power to virtualize the
          characters into the real world. It means that the software and
          hardware must be improved by optimizing the operating system allowing
          AI to use the device's resources efficiently, and developing new tools
          and SDKs (Software Development Kits) that facilitate the AI
          development.

          In addition, many smartphone brands have started integrating engines
          or chips for machine learning. Huawei put the first Neural Engine into
          their smartphones last year, called Kirin processor / 970 chipset [3].
          Moreover, Apple has put AI processors into the A12 bionic chip, making
          AI task processing more efficient. They are investing in user
          experience in AI on mobile devices by improving performance and
          battery efficiency. The trend is potentially the subsequent technology
          in the next 5 - 10 years.

          As you can see, the developer with skill sets in mobile development,
          either native or cross-platform, combined with the machine learning
          skill set, would easily ride on the trend. Using ML and AI to help us
          solve the problem will also be a solution to getting on the train. The
          legacy programming languages such as Objective-C and Java (possibly)
          for mobile development could get abandoned because of the reduction of
          community. The Swift programming language (backed by Apple) [4] could
          replace Objective-C, and Kotlin could replace Java (backed by Google)
          [5]. Mixing modern high-level programming languages and knowledge of
          AI and ML could become a way to speak about job-related.
